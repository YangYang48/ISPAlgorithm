# OVERVIEW

This source code provides an implementation of the NL-means denoising algorithm as described in IPOL
    http://www.ipol.im/pub/algo/bcm_non_local_means_denoising/

This program reads and writes PNG images, but can be easily
adapted to any other file format.

Only 8bit RGB PNG images are handled. 


# REQUIREMENTS

The code is written in ANSI C and C++, and should compile on any
system with an ANSI C/C++ compiler.

The libpng header and libraries are required on the system for
compilation and execution. 

The implementation uses OPENMP which not supported by old versions of gcc (older than the 4.2). 


# COMPILATION

Simply use the provided makefile, with the command `make`.


# USAGE

usage: nlmeans_ipol image sigma noisy denoised 

`nlmeans_ipol ` takes 5 parameter: `nlmeans_ipol in.png sigma add_noise noisy.png denoised.png`
* `sigma`     : the noise standard deviation
* `add_noise`     : the add noise option
* `in.png`   : initial noise free image
* `noisy.png`  : noisy image used by the denoising algorithm
* `denoised.png` : denoised image
